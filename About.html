    <h1>About Janet</h1>
  
    <p>Am Janet Kollie, Student of the G.W Gibson High School and that of the Nova Web Development, am excited to be a young girl who wants to learn a lot about ICT, and am appreciative to God' and that of my role model, that I got the chance to start learning web Development. It is more Easier for me to learn faster when I have someone to direct me, and to help analysis some of the problems I may have.<br>I like reading, and that is because it helps alot and I like pratical learning just like what am doing as a girl who want to learn ICT.<br>There are other things I like ,some of them  recquire study, Exercie,music, sport and etc.But I want you to know that I dont do all of these things on a daily basic, expect for study that is very important that I cant afford to risk it. Am going to stop talking about myself for now and maybe next time I can continue.</p>
