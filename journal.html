        well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
        through some interesting places on the way:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walla walla, wa</li>
        <li>Magic city ,ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last chance, Co</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
        <li>Truth or consequences, Nm</li>
    </ol>

        I saw some Burma shave style signs on the side of the
        road today: "passing cars, when you can't see.may get"
        you, A glimpse, of eternity." I definitely won't be passing
        any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I cant't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go. because I'm on a segway,
        I wasnt't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>cell phone</li>
        <li>ipod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>

    Just the essentials. As
    Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one segway.</q>
