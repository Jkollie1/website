<h1>Special Characters</h1>
<p>Since &lt;, &gt; and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves.Instead, you need to use the so called  "special characters" to represent them. for example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &it; to represent it.</p>
